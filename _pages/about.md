I'm an undergraduate student from the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering(EIE)](https://eie.bjtu.edu.cn) of [Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU)](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests mainly include deep learning, computer vision, generative models based on multimodal data, 3D scene reconstruction, etc.


Academic Interaction
======
My work during my undergraduate years benefited from the guidance and assistance of the following professors, who were my important collaborators. In March 2024, I was an academic intern in [Assi. Prof. Li Wei](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/liweileev/zh_CN/index.htm) research group at Southwest Jiaotong University. In June of the same year, I started a __undergraduate student innovation project__ with [Prof. Bai Huihui](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8181/) from [the Institute of Information Science](http://iis.bjtu.edu.cn/) at Beijing Jiaotong University. During my undergraduate years, my supervisor was [Asso. Prof. Zhou Hang](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/eaie/8139.html) from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering. __I am extremely grateful to the above-mentioned Porfessors for their help and guidance to me!__
